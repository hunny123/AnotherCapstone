It's a new field for me and I know It may be challenging but I promised that I will show complete devotion and hard work and smart work too to complete this challenge. This scholarship greatly helps me getting job ready. In the end, it is just not a scholarship for me but it will be great opportunity and path to getting success in my life.

   I am in currently pursuing the bachelors in computer science adding such a great skill on my CV is sure a great thing for my future besides that I always want to know how driverless actually works? how will this help? may it increase the chance on roads? All this question coming to my mind but I didn't find answers on the net but I came to hear about this  Lyft scholarship on Udacity.

I am greatly interested in this course and It's very great for my future to learn such great technology or skill. I wanted to future job ready with this skill. My goal is to get a good and great job.
